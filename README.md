# Brain State Detection With Liquid Neural Network (LNN)

A local web application that can predict the brain state of a human i.e, 'negative', 'neutral', 'positive' using state of the art Liquid Neural Network (LNN). Currently, users can select any of the data points from the dataset, generate its graph for visualization and view the model prediction results.
